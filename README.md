# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
	The purpose of this analysis was to organize the employee information in a meaninful way that
would be relevant to the future of the company. For an example, at the end of deliverable 1, we were
able to determine the the number of employees with what title are close to retiring giving insight to
the company in terms of how they will prepare for the amount of positions and what kind of positions
they will be losing and needing to fill. Deliverable 2 allows us to see which employee the company will
be able to reach out to regarding their interest in the mentorship program to ease the transition of
bringing new people on board.

## Results
- The table from deliverable 1 allows us to see that the two highest count positions the company will
be losing will be senior positions
- The table from deliverable 1 could mean that since senior positions that are being held will be soon
gone, this could also mean for many possible promotions which could be an incentive for current
employees to stay
- The table from deliverable 2 allows for the company to specifically seek certain employees for their
interest in the mentorship program
- The table from deliverable 2 could also be changed as well to look for employees with specific titles,
if they are only interested in creating the mentorship program for specific positions such as senior staff
versus staff

## Summary
	When considering how many roles will be need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to
make an impact, with the assumption that all titles must be filled, we would find the total number
of titles that will be retiring which would be 90,398 titles.
	With the question of whether there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the
departments to mentor the next generation employees, it would be a good start to look at the number
of employees in senior positions. When we look at the counts of the titles, we see that the senior
positions make up around half of the retirement ready employees. With that in mind, it would be safe
to assume that there are enough qualified retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation
employees.
